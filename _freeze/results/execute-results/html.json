[@tbl-demo] presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of these participants. \n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/mak_demo_table.qmd#tbl-demo >}} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Adherence\n\n#### Participation\nA total of 336 participants enrolled in our study and provided at least one month of EMA data. @fig-1 shows participant attrition over 12 months.  \n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/ana_adherence.qmd#fig-1 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Daily and Monthly Updates\nThe overall adherence for the daily updates was 75%. @fig-2 shows the overall adherence rates for the daily update by month on study. The overall adherence for the monthly updates was 96%.  \n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/ana_adherence.qmd#fig-2 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n### Participant Experience Questionannaire Quantitative Results\n247 participants provided at least four months of data and completed the participant experience questionnaire. These participants were included in following analyses.\n\n<!--Look at differences by demographics and lapses -->\n\n#### Interference\n84% of participants (N = 207/247) disagreed (i.e., endorsing \"Strongly disagree\" or \"Mildly disagree\") with the statement \"Completing the daily update interfered with my daily activities\". 79% of participants (N = 196/247) disagreed with the statement \"Completing the monthly update interfered with my daily activities\". We provide histograms of participant responses in the supplement.   \n\nAn ICC (type 3) showed that, on average, interference ratings were moderately consistent across the two updates, ICC = .50, 95% CI = [.40 - .59].\n\n\n#### Dislike\n85% of participants (N = 211/247) disagreed with the statement \"I disliked completing the daily update\". 73% of participants (N = 179/246) disagreed with the statement \"I disliked completing the monthly update\". Fewer participants disagreed with the statement \"I disliked [sensing method]\" for geolocation (65%; N = 161/247), SMS and phone logs (64%; N = 158/246), and SMS content (64%; N = 156/245). As a result we saw an increase in responses endorsing a neutral stance toward these passive sensing methods (\"Agree and disagree equally\"). We provide histograms of participant responses by sensing method in the supplement.   \n\nAn ICC (type 3) showed that, on average, dislike ratings were moderately consistent across sensing methods, ICC = .48, 95% CI = [.42 - .54].\n\n\n### Participant Experience Questionannaire Qualitative Results\n\n#### Thematic Analysis\n\n#### Topic Modeling\n",
